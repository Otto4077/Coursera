# Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains my notes and projects from the **Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization**. This specialization is designed to build the mathematical foundations necessary for understanding and applying machine learning algorithms. The courses cover topics such as linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and principal component analysis (PCA).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Notes**: A collection of Markdown files containing detailed notes from each course.
- **Projects**: Hands-on projects and assignments completed during the specialization.
